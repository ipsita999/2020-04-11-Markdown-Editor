Had a lot of fun!

Created the ditor using react.

Initially I struggled. I ssed React context to get functionality running. However, I was only able to get it to work when i used styled-components. found out about it online so had a lot of help. Interested in learning how it would make it work using just regular css. I was not able to pass down my context.
